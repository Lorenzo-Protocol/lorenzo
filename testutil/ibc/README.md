# IBC Testing

This package contains the necessary code to test the IBC modules. It is a forked version of IBC Testing, customized for Lorenzo. 

The customization aims to maximize compatibility with the original source code while ensuring it is suitably adapted for Lorenzoâ€™s specific requirements.

The maintainer must keep it updated with the currently used version of the IBC code repository to ensure ongoing compatibility and functionality.
